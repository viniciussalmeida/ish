New stuff:
- pseudoterminals (in other words, you can now ssh into your phone)
- 1337 h4x0r colorscheme
- Command-K clears the screen
- bit testing instructions implemented

Bug fixes:
- DNS configuration not working for IPv6 servers
- [invalid utf8]
- Crash when attempting to use negative file descriptors
- Various other memory leaks and segfaults

Here's a quick step by step guide for running an ssh server.
1. apk add openssh
2. ssh-keygen -A
3. passwd
4. type a password
5. /usr/sbin/sshd
You should now be able to ssh to your device with username root and the password you typed.

If you switch to another app and switch back, the ssh server will stop responding even though it's still running. Fixing this is actually really hard; help would be appreciated.
